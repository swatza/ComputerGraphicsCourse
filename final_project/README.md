Spencer Watza : 5229
Final Project: Hester's Farm

This is the readme for the final project. The purpose of this project is to 
demonstrate the things learned in the 5229 course.

Experience a time on the farm looking at some cow's on Hester's farm. And
perhaps you'll get a secret sneak peek of the night life.

The scene begins with dusk setting in a farm. There are some windmills, water containers, hay bales, and cows.
Some of the cows are wandering around late at night. While others stand around doing nothing. 

With your flashlight, you might be able to find a dancing cow in the area. 

What I am impressed is by how clean my animations are and the method I am doing to create in-between frames utilizing linear motion between key frames. The rigging system took the longest which wasn't covered in class (that I know of) and is very complicated to do by code (hence why most systems for animation are user interface and have been developed over decades). While this submitted version only has a small dance sequence, I would like to add additional dance steps before the show and tell, where i will discuss the hardships of animation by code. I think the overall creation of a scene utilizing the basic components taught in class and then adding animations to certain parts indicates understanding of the core material, data structures, and way too much coding in C. 

Inputs:

	Esc				Exit
	w,a,s,d 		Movement (1st Person)
	Mouse 			Look-around
	f               Toggle Flash Light
	p 				Start Dance Party


Time:
60ish hours

A lot of time (maybe half) was spent figuring out a good way to animate the cow and constructing a simple tool to aid in 
finding key frames before figuring out this current method (which is what led me to be behind). About 20 hours was setting up, debugging, and creating all the other assets and scenes.  The last bit was coming up with the animations and minor tweaking. 

My artistic view changed early on away from the barn because i could not find art assets to use and decided to remain outdoors. While the dance wasn't as big as I wanted, I started focusing on other things in order to provide a Minimum Viable Product to give me some time to think over the animation parts. Now that the animation is finished and integrated, it is much quicker to develop new key frames. 

Known Issues/Errors:
-Not enough polygons in simple assets causing problems with lighting 
-Edge clipping of Skybox
