HW3 Lighting and Textures

Perspective Mode Only Cow in a pasture with a partially revolving sun 
to show that it moves and the lighting changes on the cows and pastures. 
Unfortuantely, the flash light mechanic was scrapped and is not included. 
The program allows for toggling a day/night lighting scheme, lighting on / off
as well as textures on/off.

Still many hours could/should be dedicated to really understanding how
the lighting is a result of the primary parameters. Unfortunately, textures
also make code less modular in the way it operates with glBegin/glEnd
